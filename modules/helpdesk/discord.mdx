## Overview

Integrate Eusate with your Discord server to provide AI-powered support through direct messages. Perfect for gaming communities, developer servers, and any Discord-based customer support.

## How It Works

Once connected, your customers can simply send a direct message to the Eusate bot. The bot will:

1. **Ask for guild selection** - Customer chooses which server they need help with
2. **Create private thread** - A dedicated private thread is created for the conversation
3. **AI assistance** - Sate provides intelligent responses to customer inquiries
4. **Human escalation** - Seamless handoff to human agents when needed
