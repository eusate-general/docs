DevSpace enables Sate (AI) to go beyond knowledge base responses by executing custom functions that interact with your infrastructure.

## What is DevSpace?

DevSpace allows you to create tools and functions that give Sate enhanced capabilities for customer support. Instead of escalating complex requests to humans, Sate can perform actions directly through your APIs.

### Example Use Case

Consider an e-commerce scenario:

1. A customer requests a refund through your support channels
2. Sate needs to verify the order exists and check refund eligibility  
3. With DevSpace functions like `get_order` and `process_refund`, Sate can handle this automatically
4. The customer gets immediate assistance without human intervention

## Core Components

DevSpace consists of two main sections:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="shield-check" href="/modules/devspace/authentication">
    Configure how Sate authenticates with your protected endpoints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Functions" icon="code" href="/modules/devspace/functions">
    Create HTTP endpoints that Sate can call to perform actions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

1. **Set up authentication** - Configure how Sate will authenticate with your APIs
2. **Create functions** - Define the endpoints Sate can call
3. **Test and deploy** - Validate your setup before going live
