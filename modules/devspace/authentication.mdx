## Overview

Authentication configuration allows Sate to access your protected endpoints on behalf of your customers. This enables secure, personalized interactions while maintaining proper authorization controls.

## Authentication Types

DevSpace supports both authenticated and unauthenticated functions:

- **Unauthenticated functions**: Public endpoints that don't require user credentials
- **Authenticated functions**: Protected endpoints that require customer authentication

## Configuration Settings

Set up authentication on the <a href={devspace} target="_blank">DevSpace platform</a> by providing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login URL">
    The endpoint where customers will authenticate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization Location">
    Where the auth token should be placed (header, query, body)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization Type">
    The type of authentication (Bearer, API Key, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Header Configuration">
    Label and value format for authorization headers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Flow

Here's how Sate handles authentication when executing protected functions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Function Execution Request">
    Sate determines it needs to call an authenticated function to help the customer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authentication Check">
    If the customer isn't authenticated, Sate sends them your configured login URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Login">
    Customer clicks the link and enters their credentials on your platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Exchange">
    Your platform validates credentials and sends authentication data to our callback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Function Execution">
    Sate uses the received token to execute the function on the customer's behalf
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Requirements

To use authenticated functions, your login endpoint must:

### 1. Accept State Parameter

Your login URL must accept a `state` parameter that we'll include:

```
https://yourapp.com/login?state=ABC123
```

### 2. Implement Callback Integration

After successful authentication, send a POST request to our callback endpoint:

**Endpoint**: `https://api.dev.eusate.com/api/v1/lab/login/callback`

**Authentication**: You must include your API key in the Authorization header. Get your API key from the platform settings.

**Required Headers**:
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Required Body Parameters**:
- `auth_token`: The customer's authentication token
- `auth_token_expires_at_seconds`: Token expiration time (Unix timestamp)
- `state`: The state parameter from the original login URL

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks and ensure tokens are properly scoped to the authenticated user.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Tokens should have appropriate expiration times and be invalidated after use when possible.
